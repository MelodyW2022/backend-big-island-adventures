A self-guided experience, you’re free to walk among the coffee trees, meet a “Kona Nightingale”, or watch how farmers used the kuriba and hoshidana to mill and dry their world-famous coffee. 

Visit the original 1920’s farmhouse where you may find the homemaker starting the fire to cook rice or making musubi for the farmer’s lunch. 

Living history gives visitors an opportunity to experience history “brought to life” by costumed interpreters who demonstrate traditional crafts, agricultural activities, and the everyday tasks of people from the past.

“Talk story” along the way with the farm’s living history interpreters and discover the story behind Kona’s gourmet crop. "
